title: "Installing Pacman Breaks Dependency"

Running one of the usual updates from the pamac gui package, returned 

     pamac: installing pacman (5.1.0-1) breaks dependency â€˜pacman<5.1

I noticed that any package on the list with a dependency must be
unchecked before continuing.

Later I checked the antergos forum to see if there was any solution.

The suggested workaround was to run 

     pacman -Syyu -d  --nodeps

The following commit apparently introduced the issue in the first
place:

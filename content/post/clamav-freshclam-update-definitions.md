as the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ClamAV" target="_blank">ClamAV arch linux wiki</a> states, **ClamAV** is:

>Clam AntiVirus is an open source (GPL) anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. It provides a number of utilities including a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a command line scanner and advanced tool for automatic database updates. Because ClamAV's main use is on file/mail servers for Windows desktops, it primarily detects Windows viruses and malware with its built-in signatures.

In order to update the definitions correctly is important to run first 

     freshclam

which should then start the update 


     ClamAV update process started at Tue Aug 28 01:16:43 2018

But then an error came up saying that:

     WARNING: Clamd was NOT notified: Can't connect to clamd through /run/clamav/clamd.ctl: No such file or directory


which left me unsure what could have been the issue.

Googling about it returned among many of the results, some as in <a href="https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-server-73/can%27t-connect-to-unix-socket-var-run-clamav-clamd-ctl-connection-refused-856847/" target="_blank">Can't connect to Unix socket /var/run//clamav/clamd.ctl</a>, which dealt with the issue.

The error here in which it dealt with **clamd.ctl** and not with **clamd.sock connect ()** as it was posted on the entry entitled <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ClamAV#Error:_Clamd_was_NOT_notified" target="_blank">Error Clamd was not notified</a>.

But after running 

      freshclam

I had already forgotten to start/enable `clamav-freshclam.service` as outlined on the Wiki <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ClamAV#Updating_database" target="_blank">ClamAV updating database</a>

so

     systemctl start clamav-freshclam.service
     systemctl enable clamav-freshclam.service

Which returned:

`Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/clamav-freshclam.service â†’ /usr/lib/systemd/system/clamav-freshclam.service.` 

Later on by calling the status of that service with

     systemctl status clamav-freshclam.service

returned

     Aug 28 01:23:43  freshclam[]: bytecode.cvd is up to date


But whether it would be necessary to enable it every time it restarts, it's something that I will deal with later on. I only needed it this time around to check some files, and that was the purpose of running it in the first place.

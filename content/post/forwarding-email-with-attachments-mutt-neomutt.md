Forwarding an email is a function usually  bound to the `f` key, but if there are any Attachments that were included on the email, high chances are,  that the attachments will not be selected.

One could go directly to the attachments in question and selectively open each one of them. This in turn, will select the attachments, save the body of the email that had been sent on the original email. To do this, one would have to further select the remainder from the list.

If various attachments are part of the email though, this otherwise seemingly
simple task, may be somewhat inconvenient.

One of the workarounds is to have `Esc-e` that uses the
current message as a template for a new one.

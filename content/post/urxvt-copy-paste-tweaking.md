 <p>I havenâ€™t read the <code>man</code> pages enough to figure out some of the parameters that play an important behavior for the full functionality of the mighty <strong>urxvt</strong>, and it was not until I read a post - which was more of a comment on the thread entitled <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=221108" target="_blank">right click paste in urxvt terminal</a> on the archlinux.org forum - when I realized that by the combination of <strong>ctrl</strong> and right mouse click would copy and paste the selected text on the X window system.</p>

Antergos wins here. Manjaro could have done better but it
didn't. 

Anyone who would want to avoid having to go through the
hassle of reinstalling and testing sane drivers under Arch
Linux should look no further. The comparison wasn't done
between all the Arch Linux based distributions, but Antergos
is the clear winner here.

No Desktop Environment under Manjaro worked to have this
driver functioning as it should have been functioning. And
this is after trying Manjaro KDE, Manjaro XFCE, the most
popular of the bunch. Didn't try it with GNOME and I wasn't
going to waste my time with it. 

Perhaps later versions would fare better, but this time
around it didn't deliver what it was expected from this
distribution. The main issue had to do with the `invalid
argument` error message from programs such as **gscan2pdf**
and also from **xsane** and in identifying and picking up
the right device other than the infamous `Noname integrated
camera` that it would only identify from the list.

After reinstalling both Manjaro KDE and the XFCE version the
problem continued in identifying the correct device.

With Antergos it worked without a major issue and for that
reason alone I recommend this distribution over Manjaro.
